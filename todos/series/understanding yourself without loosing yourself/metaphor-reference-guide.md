# 🧭 Metaphor Reference Guide

**For: *Understanding Yourself Without Losing Yourself***

**Purpose:**
Provide a flexible library of trauma-aware metaphors that can be used **independently or selectively across the series**, without creating dependency, prescription, or ideology.

**Editorial Rule:**
Metaphors are **orientation tools**, not explanations or instructions.
Readers only need to retain **one** for the series to work.

---

## GLOBAL USAGE GUIDELINES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

* Use **one metaphor at a time** in a section
* Introduce it briefly; **do not explain or extend**
* Never present a metaphor as “the correct model”
* Never require familiarity with previous posts
* Avoid stacking metaphors back-to-back
* Metaphors should **reduce shame**, not imply control
