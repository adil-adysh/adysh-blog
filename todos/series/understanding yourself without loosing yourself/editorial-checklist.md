# 🧭 Editorial Checklist

## *Understanding Yourself Without Losing Yourself*

---

## ✅ 1. Core Ethos (Non-Negotiable)

* ☐ Am I **orienting**, not fixing?
* ☐ Did I help the reader locate themselves on the map — not tell them who to become?
* ☐ Did I reduce confusion and shame rather than add pressure?
* ☐ Is understanding presented as **optional**, not an obligation?

> **Failing this section = rewrite the piece.**

---

## 🎙️ 2. Voice & Stance

* ☐ Am I writing as a **Fellow Traveler**, not an authority or guru?
* ☐ Did I avoid “you must,” “do this,” or “here’s the cure” language?
* ☐ Are personal examples **illustrative**, not confessional?
* ☐ Does the tone land as: *“This is hard — and you are capable”*?

---

## 🛡️ 3. Psychological Safety

* ☐ Did I normalize the experience **before** explaining it?
* ☐ If boundaries, confrontation, or change are mentioned, did I include:

  > “If this puts your safety at risk, don’t do it. Survival comes first.”
* ☐ Did I remind readers to check **sleep, food, rest, sunlight** where relevant?
* ☐ Did I explicitly normalize **forgetting, regression, and slipping back**?

---

## 🌍 4. Reality Check (Anti-Gaslighting)

* ☐ Did I acknowledge that some fear is **real and present**, not psychological residue?
* ☐ Did I avoid implying that all anxiety comes from childhood or trauma?
* ☐ Did I avoid suggesting calm is always accessible through insight alone?
* ☐ Did I avoid individualizing **economic, environmental, or systemic stress**?

> Use or imply:
> *“Sometimes fear isn’t a memory — it’s information.”*

---

## 🧠 5. Shame-Safe Language

* ☐ Did I avoid moral labels (weak, needy, selfish, immature)?
* ☐ Did I describe patterns using **mechanical/system language** instead?
* ☐ Did I clearly separate:

  * Feeling ≠ Choosing
  * Feeling ≠ Acting
* ☐ Did every pattern include a **protective origin** (“At some point, this helped”)?

---

## ⚖️ 6. Responsibility Without Blame

* ☐ Did I distinguish **agency** from **control**?
* ☐ Did I avoid implying the reader controls their reactions?
* ☐ Did I include (or imply):

  > “You’re responsible for responses — not for having reactions.”

---

## 🔍 7. Facing Fear (Without Forcing)

* ☐ Did I redefine “facing” as **curiosity**, not pushing through?
* ☐ Did I avoid exposure, challenge, or “power through” framing?
* ☐ If a practice is included, is it:

  * optional
  * low-stakes
  * non-urgent?

---

## 🧩 8. Trauma-Aware Check

* ☐ No graphic detail
* ☐ No diagnosis
* ☐ No ranking or comparison
* ☐ Trauma framed as **learning under prolonged threat**
* ☐ Present-day safety prioritized over insight

---

## 🧭 9. Advice vs Orientation

* ☐ Did I offer **questions or noticing**, not prescriptions?
* ☐ Did I avoid routines, rules, or promises of outcomes?
* ☐ Does insight **expand choice** rather than create obligation?

---

## 🧱 10. Structure Check (Per Post)

* ☐ Starts with lived confusion or pain
* ☐ Includes normalization (“this makes sense”)
* ☐ Explains a simple mechanism
* ☐ Offers a gentle reframing
* ☐ Ends with a reflection question — **not a solution**

---

## 📐 11. Readability & Form

* ☐ Short paragraphs (2–3 sentences for heavy ideas)
* ☐ **Core truths bolded**
* ☐ One clear takeaway
* ☐ Enough white space to breathe

---

## 🚫 12. Anti-Guru Final Gate (Must Pass All)

Answer **NO** to all:

* ☐ Did I promise a cure or transformation?
* ☐ Did I imply the reader is broken?
* ☐ Did I confuse awareness with obligation?
* ☐ Did I deny real-world stress by over-psychologizing?
* ☐ Did I push instead of invite?

If **any answer is YES → revise.**

---

## ❤️ Final Heart Check

* ☐ Would a 16-year-old feel **safer** after reading this?
* ☐ Would a shamed reader feel **less alone**?
* ☐ Does this reduce inner conflict rather than create a new one?

> **If yes — publish.**

## Core Lines to Keep Visible While Writing

> **Nothing needs to be justified to be noticed.**
> **Understanding is not a demand to change.**
